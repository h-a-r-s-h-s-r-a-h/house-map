Let's prioritize which rooms are most important to you in terms of size.  Do you envision an open-plan layout or more separated rooms?  Consider the flow between rooms; for example, how would you like the kitchen to connect with the dining and living areas?  A galley kitchen might be space-efficient, while an open-plan living, dining, and kitchen could create a more spacious feel.  Let's discuss these options to create a functional and comfortable home within your 1200 sq ft.\n"

This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards?

Remember,  a 1200 sq ft house requires careful space planning to comfortably accommodate all desired elements, especially considering your essential components: a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Let's discuss a layout.  To maximize space,  consider an open-plan concept for the living and dining areas.  This would allow for a larger, more spacious feel.  We could allocate approximately 350 sq ft for this combined area.  A kitchen of 150 sq ft would be efficient and functional.  One master bedroom around 150 sq ft with an en-suite bathroom (incorporating the toilet) of around 50 sq ft is feasible.   A balcony of 50 sq ft and a smaller pooja room and study, possibly combined into one space of 100 sq ft, could be accommodated.  This would leave some buffer space.

Your `essential_components` list includes a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Note that you've already listed all these essential components in your `user_input`.\n\nGiven the 1200 sq ft area, we need to carefully plan the space allocation to ensure functionality and comfort.  A preliminary layout might suggest the following, but we need to discuss your preferences regarding room sizes and orientations:\n\n Living Room:  This is typically the largest room in a house.  We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards? (e.g., modern, traditional, minimalist)\n\nLet's refine this based on your answers.\n"

Let's discuss a layout.  To maximize space,  consider an open-plan concept for the living and dining areas.  This would allow for a larger, more spacious feel.  We could allocate approximately 350 sq ft for this combined area.  A kitchen of 150 sq ft would be efficient and functional.  One master bedroom around 150 sq ft with an en-suite bathroom (incorporating the toilet) of around 50 sq ft is feasible.   A balcony of 50 sq ft and a smaller pooja room and study, possibly combined into one space of 100 sq ft, could be accommodated.  This would leave some buffer space.

Your `essential_components` list includes a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Note that you've already listed all these essential components in your `user_input`.\n\nGiven the 1200 sq ft area, we need to carefully plan the space allocation to ensure functionality and comfort.  A preliminary layout might suggest the following, but we need to discuss your preferences regarding room sizes and orientations:\n\n Living Room:  This is typically the largest room in a house.  We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards?

Note that you've already listed all these essential components in your `user_input`.\n\nGiven the 1200 sq ft area, we need to carefully plan the space allocation to ensure functionality and comfort.  A preliminary layout might suggest the following, but we need to discuss your preferences regarding room sizes and orientations:\n\n Living Room:  This is typically the largest room in a house.  We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards?

Your `essential_components` list includes a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Note that you've already listed all these essential components in your `user_input`.\n\nGiven the 1200 sq ft area, we need to carefully plan the space allocation to ensure functionality and comfort.  A preliminary layout might suggest the following, but we need to discuss your preferences regarding room sizes and orientations:\n\n Living Room:  This is typically the largest room in a house.  We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards?

Your `essential_components` list includes a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Note that you've already listed all these essential components in your `user_input`.\n\nGiven the 1200 sq ft area, we need to carefully plan the space allocation to ensure functionality and comfort.  A preliminary layout might suggest the following, but we need to discuss your preferences regarding room sizes and orientations:\n\n Living Room:  This is typically the largest room in a house.  We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards?

Note that you've already listed all these essential components in your `user_input`.\n\nGiven the 1200 sq ft area, we need to carefully plan the space allocation to ensure functionality and comfort.  A preliminary layout might suggest the following, but we need to discuss your preferences regarding room sizes and orientations:\n\n Living Room:  This is typically the largest room in a house.  We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards?

Your `essential_components` list includes a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Note that you've already listed all these essential components in your `user_input`.\n\nGiven the 1200 sq ft area, we need to carefully plan the space allocation to ensure functionality and comfort.  A preliminary layout might suggest the following, but we need to discuss your preferences regarding room sizes and orientations:\n\n Living Room:  This is typically the largest room in a house.  We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards?

We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards? (e.g., modern, traditional, minimalist)\n\nLet's refine this based on your answers.\n"

Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards?

A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards?

Note that you've already listed all these essential components in your `user_input`.\n\nGiven the 1200 sq ft area, we need to carefully plan the space allocation to ensure functionality and comfort.  A preliminary layout might suggest the following, but we need to discuss your preferences regarding room sizes and orientations:\n\n Living Room:  This is typically the largest room in a house.  We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.

We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards?

Note that you've already listed all these essential components in your `user_input`.\n\nGiven the 1200 sq ft area, we need to carefully plan the space allocation to ensure functionality and comfort.  A preliminary layout might suggest the following, but we need to discuss your preferences regarding room sizes and orientations:\n\n Living Room:  This is typically the largest room in a house.  We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards?

A preliminary layout might suggest the following, but we need to discuss your preferences regarding room sizes and orientations:\n\n Living Room:  This is typically the largest room in a house.  We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards?

Remember,  a 1200 sq ft house requires careful space planning to comfortably accommodate all desired elements, especially considering your essential components: a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Let's discuss a layout.  To maximize space,  consider an open-plan concept for the living and dining areas.  This would allow for a larger, more spacious feel.  We could allocate approximately 350 sq ft for this combined area.  A kitchen of 150 sq ft would be efficient and functional.  One master bedroom around 150 sq ft with an en-suite bathroom (incorporating the toilet) of around 50 sq ft is feasible.   A balcony of 50 sq ft and a smaller pooja room and study, possibly combined into one space of 100 sq ft, could be accommodated.  This would leave some buffer space.

Your `essential_components` list includes a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Note that you've already listed all these essential components in your `user_input`.\n\nGiven the 1200 sq ft area, we need to carefully plan the space allocation to ensure functionality and comfort.  A preliminary layout might suggest the following, but we need to discuss your preferences regarding room sizes and orientations:\n\n Living Room:  This is typically the largest room in a house.  We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards? (e.g., modern, traditional, minimalist)\n\nLet's refine this based on your answers.\n"

Remember to include the essential components: bedroom, toilet, kitchen, and living room\u2014you've included these but efficient placement is crucial.  We need to prioritize the sizing of each room to ensure functionality. Let's discuss space allocation for each room. How many bedrooms do you envision? What's your preferred layout \u2013 open-plan or more compartmentalized?  Also,  a dining room is listed as essential and is included in your request, so let\u2019s discuss how we integrate that.\n"

Your `essential_components` list includes a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Note that you've already listed all these essential components in your `user_input`.\n\nGiven the 1200 sq ft area, we need to carefully plan the space allocation to ensure functionality and comfort.  A preliminary layout might suggest the following, but we need to discuss your preferences regarding room sizes and orientations:\n\n Living Room:  This is typically the largest room in a house.  We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards? (e.g., modern, traditional, minimalist)\n\nLet's refine this based on your answers.\n"

We could allocate approximately 350 sq ft for this combined area.  A kitchen of 150 sq ft would be efficient and functional.  One master bedroom around 150 sq ft with an en-suite bathroom (incorporating the toilet) of around 50 sq ft is feasible.   A balcony of 50 sq ft and a smaller pooja room and study, possibly combined into one space of 100 sq ft, could be accommodated.  This would leave some buffer space.

Your `essential_components` list includes a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Note that you've already listed all these essential components in your `user_input`.\n\nGiven the 1200 sq ft area, we need to carefully plan the space allocation to ensure functionality and comfort.  A preliminary layout might suggest the following, but we need to discuss your preferences regarding room sizes and orientations:\n\n Living Room:  This is typically the largest room in a house.  We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards? (e.g., modern, traditional, minimalist)\n\nLet's refine this based on your answers.\n"

Your `essential_components` list includes a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Note that you've already listed all these essential components in your `user_input`.\n\nGiven the 1200 sq ft area, we need to carefully plan the space allocation to ensure functionality and comfort.  A preliminary layout might suggest the following, but we need to discuss your preferences regarding room sizes and orientations:\n\n Living Room:  This is typically the largest room in a house.  We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards? (e.g., modern, traditional, minimalist)\n\nLet's refine this based on your answers.\n"

Remember,  a 1200 sq ft house requires careful space planning to comfortably accommodate all desired elements, especially considering your essential components: a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Let's discuss a layout.  To maximize space,  consider an open-plan concept for the living and dining areas.  This would allow for a larger, more spacious feel.  We could allocate approximately 350 sq ft for this combined area.  A kitchen of 150 sq ft would be efficient and functional.  One master bedroom around 150 sq ft with an en-suite bathroom (incorporating the toilet) of around 50 sq ft is feasible.   A balcony of 50 sq ft and a smaller pooja room and study, possibly combined into one space of 100 sq ft, could be accommodated.  This would leave some buffer space. However, to refine this plan, I need further information.  How many bedrooms do you envision? What is your preference for open-plan or more separated spaces?

Your `essential_components` list includes a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Note that you've already listed all these essential components in your `user_input`.\n\nGiven the 1200 sq ft area, we need to carefully plan the space allocation to ensure functionality and comfort.  A preliminary layout might suggest the following, but we need to discuss your preferences regarding room sizes and orientations:\n\n Living Room:  This is typically the largest room in a house.  We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards? (e.g., modern, traditional, minimalist)\n\nLet's refine this based on your answers.\n"

One master bedroom around 150 sq ft with an en-suite bathroom (incorporating the toilet) of around 50 sq ft is feasible.   A balcony of 50 sq ft and a smaller pooja room and study, possibly combined into one space of 100 sq ft, could be accommodated.  This would leave some buffer space.

Remember to include the essential components: bedroom, toilet, kitchen, and living room\u2014you've included these but efficient placement is crucial.

Your `essential_components` list includes a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Note that you've already listed all these essential components in your `user_input`.\n\nGiven the 1200 sq ft area, we need to carefully plan the space allocation to ensure functionality and comfort.  A preliminary layout might suggest the following, but we need to discuss your preferences regarding room sizes and orientations:\n\n Living Room:  This is typically the largest room in a house.  We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards? (e.g., modern, traditional, minimalist)\n\nLet's refine this based on your answers.\n"

Remember,  a 1200 sq ft house requires careful space planning to comfortably accommodate all desired elements, especially considering your essential components: a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Let's discuss a layout.  To maximize space,  consider an open-plan concept for the living and dining areas.  This would allow for a larger, more spacious feel.  We could allocate approximately 350 sq ft for this combined area.  A kitchen of 150 sq ft would be efficient and functional.  One master bedroom around 150 sq ft with an en-suite bathroom (incorporating the toilet) of around 50 sq ft is feasible.   A balcony of 50 sq ft and a smaller pooja room and study, possibly combined into one space of 100 sq ft, could be accommodated.  This would leave some buffer space. However, to refine this plan, I need further information.  How many bedrooms do you envision? What is your preference for open-plan or more separated spaces?

Your `essential_components` list includes a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Note that you've already listed all these essential components in your `user_input`.\n\nGiven the 1200 sq ft area, we need to carefully plan the space allocation to ensure functionality and comfort.  A preliminary layout might suggest the following, but we need to discuss your preferences regarding room sizes and orientations:\n\n Living Room:  This is typically the largest room in a house.  We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards? (e.g., modern, traditional, minimalist)\n\nLet's refine this based on your answers.\n"

Remember,  a 1200 sq ft house requires careful space planning to comfortably accommodate all desired elements, especially considering your essential components: a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Let's discuss a layout.  To maximize space,  consider an open-plan concept for the living and dining areas.  This would allow for a larger, more spacious feel.  We could allocate approximately 350 sq ft for this combined area.  A kitchen of 150 sq ft would be efficient and functional.  One master bedroom around 150 sq ft with an en-suite bathroom (incorporating the toilet) of around 50 sq ft is feasible.   A balcony of 50 sq ft and a smaller pooja room and study, possibly combined into one space of 100 sq ft, could be accommodated.  This would leave some buffer space.

Your `essential_components` list includes a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Note that you've already listed all these essential components in your `user_input`.\n\nGiven the 1200 sq ft area, we need to carefully plan the space allocation to ensure functionality and comfort.  A preliminary layout might suggest the following, but we need to discuss your preferences regarding room sizes and orientations:\n\n Living Room:  This is typically the largest room in a house.  We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards? (e.g., modern, traditional, minimalist)\n\nLet's refine this based on your answers.\n"

Your `essential_components` list includes a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Note that you've already listed all these essential components in your `user_input`.\n\nGiven the 1200 sq ft area, we need to carefully plan the space allocation to ensure functionality and comfort.  A preliminary layout might suggest the following, but we need to discuss your preferences regarding room sizes and orientations:\n\n Living Room:  This is typically the largest room in a house.  We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards? (e.g., modern, traditional, minimalist)\n\nLet's refine this based on your answers.\n"

Remember,  a 1200 sq ft house requires careful space planning to comfortably accommodate all desired elements, especially considering your essential components: a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Let's discuss a layout.  To maximize space,  consider an open-plan concept for the living and dining areas.  This would allow for a larger, more spacious feel.  We could allocate approximately 350 sq ft for this combined area.  A kitchen of 150 sq ft would be efficient and functional.  One master bedroom around 150 sq ft with an en-suite bathroom (incorporating the toilet) of around 50 sq ft is feasible.   A balcony of 50 sq ft and a smaller pooja room and study, possibly combined into one space of 100 sq ft, could be accommodated.  This would leave some buffer space. However, to refine this plan, I need further information.  How many bedrooms do you envision? What is your preference for open-plan or more separated spaces?

Your `essential_components` list includes a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Note that you've already listed all these essential components in your `user_input`.\n\nGiven the 1200 sq ft area, we need to carefully plan the space allocation to ensure functionality and comfort.  A preliminary layout might suggest the following, but we need to discuss your preferences regarding room sizes and orientations:\n\n Living Room:  This is typically the largest room in a house.  We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards? (e.g., modern, traditional, minimalist)\n\nLet's refine this based on your answers.\n"

Remember to include the essential components: bedroom, toilet, kitchen, and living room\u2014you've included these but efficient placement is crucial.  We need to prioritize the sizing of each room to ensure functionality. Let's discuss space allocation for each room. How many bedrooms do you envision?

Your `essential_components` list includes a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Note that you've already listed all these essential components in your `user_input`.\n\nGiven the 1200 sq ft area, we need to carefully plan the space allocation to ensure functionality and comfort.  A preliminary layout might suggest the following, but we need to discuss your preferences regarding room sizes and orientations:\n\n Living Room:  This is typically the largest room in a house.  We could aim for roughly 300-350 sq ft, depending on your desired furniture layout and whether you intend to incorporate a dining area within.\n\n Kitchen:  A standard kitchen in this size home could range from 150-200 sq ft.  Consider the placement relative to the dining area for efficient flow.\n\n Bedrooms:  The number and size of bedrooms depend on your needs.  With a 1200 sq ft area, two comfortably sized bedrooms (around 100-150 sq ft each) are feasible.  Consider a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom if desired.\n\n Bathrooms:  One bathroom (the toilet you've listed) is a minimum; however, with two bedrooms an additional bathroom is highly recommended for convenience. This will impact space allocation significantly.\n\n Dining Room: You've listed this as essential.  This could integrate with the living room (open-plan concept) or be a separate space of around 100-150 sq ft.  This depends on your preferences and the size of the living room.\n\n Balcony: The size of the balcony will depend on its location and the overall design.  A small balcony of 50-75 sq ft is a realistic option.\n\n Study Room: This room could be compact, potentially 75-100 sq ft, depending on your needs.\n\n Pooja Room:  A small pooja room, around 50-75 sq ft, can be easily accommodated.\n\nWe need to discuss further to finalize the layout.  Consider sharing your preferences on:\n\n Open-plan vs. closed-plan layout: Do you prefer an open-plan living/dining area, or separate rooms?\n Room size priorities: Which rooms are most important to you in terms of size?\n Lighting and ventilation:  How important is natural light and ventilation in your design?\n Style preferences: What architectural style are you leaning towards? (e.g., modern, traditional, minimalist)\n\nLet's refine this based on your answers.\n"

Remember,  a 1200 sq ft house requires careful space planning to comfortably accommodate all desired elements, especially considering your essential components: a bedroom, toilet, kitchen, living room, and dining room.  Let's discuss a layout.  To maximize space,  consider an open-plan concept for the living and dining areas.  This would allow for a larger, more spacious feel.  We could allocate approximately 350 sq ft for this combined area.  A kitchen of 150 sq ft would be efficient and functional.  One master bedroom around 150 sq ft with an en-suite bathroom (incorporating the toilet) of around 50 sq ft is feasible.   A balcony of 50 sq ft and a smaller pooja room and study, possibly combined into one space of 100 sq ft, could be accommodated.  This would leave some buffer space. However, to refine this plan, I need further information.  How many bedrooms do you envision? What is your preference for open-plan or more separated spaces?
